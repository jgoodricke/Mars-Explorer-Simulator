Mars Explorer Simulator(Simple Version)
===================

Description
-----------

- The application is a simulation of a mars explorer moving on a square tabletop,
  of dimensions 5 units x 5 units.
- The explorer is free to roam around the surface of the table, but must be
  prevented from falling to destruction. Any movement that would result in the
  explorer falling from the table must be prevented, however further valid
  movement commands must still be allowed.
- The explorer only can move to the sorrounding units vertically or horizontally.

Create an application that can read in commands of the following (textual) form:

    PLACE X,Y
    MOVE X,Y
    REPORT

- PLACE will put the mars explorer on the table in position X,Y.
    - The origin (0,0) can be considered to be the bottom left most corner. 
    - The first valid command to the explorer is a PLACE command, after that, any
    sequence of commands may be issued, in any order, including another PLACE
    command. The application should discard all commands in the sequence until
    a valid PLACE command has been executed.

- REPORT will announce the X,Y of the explorer, and the positions of blocks.
    - A explorer that is not on the table can choose to ignore the REPORT command.

- MOVE will find the proper path to move from the original position 
    to the target position X,Y through units along the path. Command will 
    print out the positions of path and change the postion to new destination.
    - A explorer that is not on the table can choose to ignore the MOVE command.
    - A explorer can choose to ignore the MOVE command, which is no 
        movement required. 
    - A explorer can only move nearest position vertically or horizontally. e.g. 
        A explorer with position (0,0) can only move to (0,1), (1,0) positions instead of (1,1).
    - A explorer  can choose to ignore the position which is not on the table


- Input can be from a file, or from standard input, as the developer chooses.
- Provide test data to exercise the application.
- The application must be a command line application.


Constraints
-----------

- The explorer must not fall off the table during movement. This also
  includes the initial placement of the toy explorer.
- Any move that would cause the explorer to fall must be ignored.

Example Input and Output

Deliverables
------------

Please provide your source code, and any test code/data you using in
developing your solution.

Please engineer your solution to a standard you consider suitable for
production. It is not required to provide any graphical output showing the
movement of the toy explorer.

Please do not put your name in any of the submitted code since this makes 
it harder for us to review your submission anonymously.
